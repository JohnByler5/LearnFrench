Here are the instructions and overview for the Learn French app!

When you open up the app, the first thing you should do is to enter your French level. The app will use this inputted level and pass it to the AI in attempt to tune responses to your understanding and knowledge. After that, you can move on to any of the other functions.

The first app function you see is the French Assitant AI Chat feature. This allows you to enter into conversation with OpenAI's ChatGPT native in the app, in the context that the AI is a French teacher which will only answer questions related to French, learning French, and related topics. You can practically ask it any question or to do anything of the sort relating to those topics. The chat will, like ChatGPT, remember previous chats until the app is restarted so all your previous messages will contribute to the context and you can expand on previous questions and answers with new questions or requests.

The next app function you see is the Translation and Dictionary Lookup feature. This allows you to translate any french or english text to the reciprocal language, using Google Translate, or to lookup any french or english phrase to get information about it in the opposite language, using the Word Reference website.

The final app function is the Random AI French Text Generation feature. This allows you to generate any random french text in the context of a dialog, article, story, or French lesson (in English), tailored to the level of the user. The text will be about any randomly chosen topic and with randomly chosen chacters, through the AI's imagination.

The extra app functions is the ability to speak the last output and to be able to switch the UI theme to dark or back to light. Due to limitations in the repl.it website, the only TTS available was Google TTS which requires a language to be specified, so some text may be read with a French accent despite being English.
